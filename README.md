This repository contains my Neovim configuration, managed with Lazy as the plugin manager. Below is a list of installed plugins and a brief explanation of their functionalities. Please note that the LSP (with Mason) and NullLS plugins are not yet fully functional; I am actively working on refining them to meet my specific needs.

## Installed Plugins:

### 1. LSP (with Mason)
The Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration, enhanced with Mason, provides language features such as autocompletion, syntax checking, and code navigation for various programming languages.

### 2. NeoTree
NeoTree is a file explorer plugin for Neovim, making it easy to navigate and manage files and directories within the editor.

### 3. Telescope
Telescope is a highly extensible fuzzy finder plugin that allows for efficient searching, previewing, and selecting files, buffers, and other elements in Neovim.

### 4. Treesitter
Treesitter is a powerful parsing library for Neovim that provides syntax highlighting, code folding, and other language-related features for a wide range of programming languages.

### 5. Onedark Theme
Onedark is a popular Neovim color scheme that offers a visually appealing and comfortable coding environment.

### 6. CMP
CMP is a completion plugin for Neovim that enhances the built-in completion menu, providing a customizable and efficient way to autocomplete code.

### 7. NullLS

## Additional Information:

- **LSP and NullLS Status:** As mentioned earlier, the LSP (with Mason) and NullLS plugins are not yet fully functional. I am actively working on improving their functionality to make them perfect for my workflow.
